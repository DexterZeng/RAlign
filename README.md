The necessary packages can be found in requirements.txt

After preparing the environment, unpackage data.zip, and just run bash auto.sh to obtain the results. 

Some important parameters:
--pb denotes whether to use progressive blocking
--agg denotes which aggregation method is used. "arith" represents the arithmetic mean and "harm" represents the harmonic mean.
--folder denotes the dataset

Due to the instability of embedding-based methods, it is acceptable that the results fluctuate a little bit (Â±1%) when running code repeatedly.
